# OctoPrint-Fortune

This is an adaptation of the original UNIX fortune program. Fortune will 
run on OctoPrint login and popup a quote or saying from a database of stored quotes.

I have not created these quotes or sayings, they are simply provided from the
source given by Brian M. Clapper as a sample set of fortunes.

There is an icon that looks like a book on the navigation bar for those that 
would like a more frequent fortune. This can be turned off in the settings page.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

the plugin manager.

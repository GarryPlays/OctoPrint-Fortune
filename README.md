# OctoPrint-Fortune

This is an adaptation of the original UNIX fortune program. Fortune will 
run on OctoPrint login and popup a quote or saying from a database of stored quotes.

I have not created these quotes or sayings, they are simply provided from the
source given by Brian M. Clapper as a sample set of fortunes.

There is an icon that looks like a book on the navigation bar for those that 
would like a more frequent fortune. This can be turned off in the settings page.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/berrystephenw/OctoPrint-Fortune/archive/main.zip


## Configuration

The only configuration is to enable or disable the icon on the navigation bar, and optionally 
to enable sending your fortune to OctoText. OctoText must be enabled and configured for
this feature to work.
